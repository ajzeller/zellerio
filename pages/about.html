                ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Andrew. Thanks for checking out my little corner of the internet. 
                I'm a 23 year old currently living in San Jose, California and
                working as a mechanical engineer at Fetch Robotics where I design the next generation
                of autonomous mobile robots for warehouses.

                Outside of work, my passion is making digital products that people love to use. 

                My most recent project is
                <a href="https://mytop50.com">mytop50.com</a>, 
                a little site that allows you to view and save
                 your top 50 tracks and artists on Spotify over different time periods.
                Over 800 Spotify users have used
                <a href="https://mytop50.com">mytop50.com</a>
                 to discover the soundtracks to their lives.

                    Find three hobbies you love: one to make you money (1), one to keep you in shape (2), and one to be creative (3).

                This quote has been a real guide in my life. For me, building useful products out of bits and atoms hits #1,
                standup-paddleboarding and weightlifting hits #2, and <a href="/photo">photography</a> hits #3.

                My specialty is beautiful, mobile-first sites optimized for speed using static site generators like
                Jekyll, which this site is built on.
