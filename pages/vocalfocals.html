        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>
            VocalFocals was my senior design project at the University of Alabama. 
            I served as the technical manager for the project and did all software development. 
            The goal of the project was to develop a proof-of-concept device that could assist 
            visually impaired individuals navigate around campus.   
        </p>
